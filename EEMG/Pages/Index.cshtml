            EEMG founded in 1960 is a professional association comprised of numerous
            companies with defense-related business relationships with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
            EEMG is not limited to electronic engineering or manufacturing as the name may imply but is
            composed of defense-related Aerospace and IT professionals. Our members include prime
            contractors, subcontractors, and their suppliers. Our roster is continually growing as more
            companies recognize the value-added benefits of EEMG membership.

            EEMG has grown over its nearly six decades by keeping in touch with all the latest technical
            and functional activities supporting the Wright-Patterson community. It is also the only local
            professional organization whose membership supports all the major WPAFB customers,
            including AFMC, AFLCMC, AFIT, NASIC, AFSAC, and AFRL.
            As a non-profit association, EEMG provides its membership a monthly opportunity to
            network, discuss opportunities, socialize, and listen to different perspectives from our
            distinguished guest speakers on topics of local and national interest to the WPAFB
            community.

            Though many of us use social networking sites; studies have shown, in person networking is
            still very important and in fact is the grounding for social networking. The forum for
            networking is our monthly luncheon, generally held every second Tuesday, September
            through June. We also provide tools such as our membership roster and website to further
            enhance communications and members’ business development activities in today&#39;s WPAFB
            marketplace.
